- GitHub - to showcase and host this project
  ## Project Objectives
  - Clean and prepare raw data on Microsoft Excel
  - Analyze the trends in music units that reflect modern shifts to streaming
  - Visualize insights on Tableau Public

  ## Dataset
  - The dataset includes:
  - Metric
  - Year
  - Value(Actual)
  - Full Date
    ## Insights
    - Sales were at it's highest in 2001 but then dipped dramatically during the years of 2002 to 2010
    - They fall a bit from 2011 to 2015 but slowly picks up from the years of 2016 to 2019
    - Units sold dipped from 2001 to 2003 but then would go up from the years of 2004 to 2008
    - They would then fall a bit again for Units from 2009 to 2010, then steady from 2011 to 2012, afterwards from 2013 units sold drops dramatically from 2013 to 2019

      ## Music Units Sold Data Visualization using Excel Data
      - I recently completed a project that visualizes trends in music unit sales in Excel and Tableau Public from 1973-2019.
      - The dataset I used included yearly data on music consumption(CD,vinyl's,casettes, etc) and the total number of units sold. I focused on cleaning the data in Excel by:
      - Creating a new full date column from year
      - extracting the month (even though only the year existed originally)
      - Filtering unnecessary columns like ?format and number of records
      - Focused on the years 2001-2019, to keep the data more modern and reflective of recent times
      - Preparing the sheet for Tableau by ensuring clean and consistent formatting
      - In Tableau Public, I built an interactive dashboard that:
      - Visualizes yearly trends in music consumption
      - Highlights the shift from physical to digital formats
      - Uses color to distinguish different metrics
      - We can see how physical formats was dominant pre-2000's, and that early 2000's shows the shift that was slowly happening to physical formats, due to the rise of streaming, digital formats, consumers switching over to those formats and their tastes changing.
      - This project helped me practice and refreshed my intermediate excel functions and translate raw data into a clear, user friendly visualizations using Tableau Public
